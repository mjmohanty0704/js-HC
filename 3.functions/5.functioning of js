    ->Memory creation phase->execution phase
3rd->Eval EC->

* 1st global execution takes place where this is automatically associated.
* Then, memory creation phase begins. Here first variables are defined as undefined and function as defined as its definition.
* Ater that execution phase takes place. In this the user defind values are assigned to the variables. 
- Then for the funtion called, a new variable environment and execution thread is generated.
- Here all the functions with the arguments are evaluated and returned back to global execution context.
* After all these steps, the new variable environment and execution thread is deleted.
